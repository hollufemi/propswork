        <Propsthree Title="The Guardian view on North Koreans in Ukraine: a Russian war is using foreign labour" Author="Guardian Editorials" Content="Around 1 million soldiers are believed to have been killed or wounded in Russia’s war in Ukraine. In addition to the vast Ukrainian civilian and military toll, average Russian casualties reportedly rose to a new height of more than 1,200 soldiers a day in September. Russia has four times as many men, but a war described by its own fighters as a “meat grinder” is rapidly diminishing the ranks, and using conscripts has a political cost. On some estimates, seven times more Russian soldiers have died since the invasion than Soviet troops died in Afghanistan in a decade." Date="Sun 20 Oct 2024 18.25 BST"/>
        <Propsthree Title="The Observer view on the death of Yahya Sinwar: Joe Biden must use this moment to press for peace" Author="Observer editorial" Content="Contrasting reactions to the chance killing by Israeli soldiers of Hamas’s top leader, Yahya Sinwar, offer a chastening guide to the dismal, dead-end politics of the Middle East. Sinwar, reputed mastermind of the 7 October 2023 massacre of about 1,200 Israelis, has paid a fitting price for his crimes. It would have been preferable had he faced trial. The same holds true of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’s political chief, assassinated by Israel in Tehran in July. Yet both these men lived by the sword. They knew the score."

        <Propsthree Title="Middle East crisis live: explosions in Beirut after Israeli warning of imminent strikes" Author="Guardian News" Content="Israel’s military announced on Sunday night that it will begin striking buildings belonging to al-Qard al-Hassan, a Hezbollah-run banking system that provides loans and banking services primarily to people who live in areas where Hezbollah is popular. Israel said that the institution finances Hezbollah and that “Hezbollah uses this money to finance its terrorist activities,” including purchasing and storing arms."
